abstract = {The speech emotion recognition system determines a speaker's emotional state by analyzing his/her speech audio signal. It is an essential at the same time a challenging task in human-computer interaction systems and is one of the most demanding areas of research using artificial intelligence and deep machine learning architectures. Despite being the world's seventh most widely spoken language, Bangla is still classified as one of the low-resource languages for speech emotion recognition tasks because of inadequate availability of data. There is an apparent lack of speech emotion recognition dataset to perform this type of research in Bangla language. This article presents a Bangla language-based emotional speech-audio recognition dataset to address this problem. BanglaSER is a Bangla language-based speech emotion recognition dataset. It consists of speech-audio data of 34 participating speakers from diverse age groups between 19 and 47 years, with a balanced 17 male and 17 female nonprofessional participating actors. This dataset contains 1467 Bangla speech-audio recordings of five rudimentary human emotional states, namely angry, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. Three trials are conducted for each emotional state. Hence, the total number of recordings involves 3 statements × 3 repetitions × 4 emotional states (angry, happy, sad, and surprise) × 34 participating speakers = 1224 recordings + 3 statements × 3 repetitions × 1 emotional state (neutral) × 27 participating speakers = 243 recordings, resulting in a total number of recordings of 1467. BanglaSER dataset is created by recording speech-audios through smartphones, and laptops, having a balanced number of recordings in each category with evenly distributed participating male and female actors, and would serve as an essential training dataset for the Bangla speech emotion recognition model in terms of generalization. BanglaSER is compatible with various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional neural networks, Long short-term memory, Gated recurrent unit, Transformer, etc. The dataset is available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t9h6p943xy/5 and can be used for research purposes.}
